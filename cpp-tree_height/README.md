# cpp-tree_height

**Problem Introduction**

In this problem, need to read a description of a tree from the input, implement the tree data structure, store the tree and compute its height.

**Problem Description**

Task is to compute and output its height. Recall that the height of a (rooted) tree is the maximum depth of a node, or the maximum distance from a leaf to the root. Given an arbitrary tree, not necessarily a binary tree.

**Input Format**

The first line contains the number of nodes n. The second line contains n integer numbers from −1 to n−1 — parents of nodes. If the ith one of them  is −1, node i is the root,otherwise it’s 0-based index of the parent of i-th node. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one root. It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.

**Constraints**

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5

**Output Format**

Output the height of the tree.
