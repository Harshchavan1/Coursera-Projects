# python-placing_parenthesis

**Problem Introduction**

In this problem, goal is to add parentheses to a given arithmetic
expression to maximize its value. max(5 - 8 + 7 × 4 - 8 + 9) =?

**Task**

Find the maximum value of an arithmetic expression by specifying the order of applying its arithmetic
operations using additional parentheses.

**Input Format**

The only line of the input contains a string ?? of length 2?? + 1 for some ??, with symbols
??0, ??1, . . . , ??2??. Each symbol at an even position of ?? is a digit (that is, an integer from 0 to 9) while
each symbol at an odd position is one of three operations from {+,-,*}.

**Constraints**

1 = ?? = 14 (hence the string contains at most 29 symbols).

**Output Format**

Output the maximum possible value of the given arithmetic expression among different
orders of applying arithmetic operations.
