# python-placing_parenthesis

**Problem Introduction**

In this problem, goal is to add parentheses to a given arithmetic
expression to maximize its value. max(5 - 8 + 7 × 4 - 8 + 9) =?

**Task**

Find the maximum value of an arithmetic expression by specifying the order of applying its arithmetic
operations using additional parentheses.

**Input Format**

The only line of the input contains a string 𝑠 of length 2𝑛 + 1 for some 𝑛, with symbols
𝑠0, 𝑠1, . . . , 𝑠2𝑛. Each symbol at an even position of 𝑠 is a digit (that is, an integer from 0 to 9) while
each symbol at an odd position is one of three operations from {+,-,*}.

**Constraints**

1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 14 (hence the string contains at most 29 symbols).

**Output Format**

Output the maximum possible value of the given arithmetic expression among different
orders of applying arithmetic operations.
