# python-max_gold

Given a set of bars of gold and goal is to take as much gold as possible into
the bag. There is just one copy of each bar and for each bar can either take it or not
(hence cannot take a fraction of a bar).

**Problem Description**

Given 𝑛 gold bars, find the maximum weight of gold that fits into a bag of capacity 𝑊.

**Input Format**

The first line of the input contains the capacity 𝑊 of a knapsack and the number 𝑛 of bars
of gold. The next line contains 𝑛 integers 𝑤0, 𝑤1, . . . , 𝑤𝑛−1 defining the weights of the bars of gold.

**Constraints**

1 ≤ 𝑊 ≤ 104; 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 300; 0 ≤ 𝑤0, . . . , 𝑤𝑛−1 ≤ 105.

**Output Format**

Output the maximum weight of gold that fits into a knapsack of capacity 𝑊
