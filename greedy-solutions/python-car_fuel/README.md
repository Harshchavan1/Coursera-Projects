Going to travel to another city that is located d miles away from home city. Car can travel
at most m miles on a full tank and car will start with a full tank. Along the way, there are gas stations at
distances stop1, stop2, . . . , stopn from home city. What is the minimum number of refills needed?


**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer d. The second line contains an integer m. The third line
specifies an integer n. Finally, the last line contains integers stop1, stop2, . . . , stopn.

**Output Format** 

Assuming that the distance between the cities is d miles, a car can travel at most m miles
on a full tank, and there are gas stations along the way, output the
minimum number of refills needed. Assume that the car starts with a full tank. If it is not possible to
reach the destination, output -1.
