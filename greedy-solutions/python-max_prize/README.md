# python-max_prize

Problem Introduction

Going to organize a funny competition for children. As a prize fund have n
candies. Would like to use these candies for top k places in a competition
with a natural restriction that a higher place gets a larger number of candies.
To make as many children happy as possible, going to find the largest
value of k for which it is possible.

Output Format. 

In the first line, output the maximum number k such that n can be represented as a sum
of k pairwise distinct positive integers. In the second line, output k pairwise distinct positive integers
that sum up to n (if there are many such representations, output any of them)
