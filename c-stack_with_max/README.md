# c-stack_with_max

**Problem Introduction**

Stack is an abstract data type supporting the operations Push()andPop(). It is not difficult to implement it in a way that both these operations work in constant time. In this problem, goal will be to implement a stack that also supports finding the maximum value and to ensure that all operations still work in constant time.

**Problem Description**

Implement a stack supporting the operations Push(),Pop(), andMax().Input Format.The first line of the input contains the number of q queries. Each of the following q lines specifies a query of one of the following formats: push v, pop, or max.

**Constraints**

1 ≤ q ≤ 400 000,0 ≤ v ≤ 10 000

**Output Format**

For each max query, output (on a separate line) the maximum value of the stack
